# web-scraper-scrapy

<h2 align='center'><b> Simple web scraping (scrapy package) </b></h2> 

---

Using JJ's example from scrapy in jupyter notebook [example here](https://www.jitsejan.com/using-scrapy-in-jupyter-notebook) and scrapy documentation to [getting started](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html), this notebook creates a simple scraper (using scrapy package) that scrape data from [Quotes To Scrape](https://quotes.toscrape.com/) and save them as .json file and .jl (json line) file to be retrieved later and be analyzed.


**obs(!):** Each time the notebook is run to scrape the data, it is necessary to restart the notebook kernel and run all the cells again

* The parsed data from [Quotes To Scrape](https://quotes.toscrape.com/) can be found in `datasets/` directory. The available files are .json or .jl.
